# LCMS-Spectator
LCMS raw data and MSGF+ results viewer

LcmsSpectator is a standalone Windows graphical user interface tool for viewing LC-MS data and identifications. 

It takes a single or multiple Thermo raw files (*.raw) or MzML file and shows  MS and MS/MS spectra as well as precursor and product ion chromatograms as resizable, floatable tabbed-documents.

Identification and target files can also be loaded to show the spectral and chromatographic evidence. The tool currently supports MS-GF+ and MSPathFinder tab-delimited results, and MzIdentML files.
