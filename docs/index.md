Windows graphical user interface tool for viewing LC-MS data and identifications.

### Description
LCMS raw data and MSGF+ results viewer

LcmsSpectator is a standalone Windows graphical user interface tool for viewing LC-MS data and identifications.

It takes a single or multiple Thermo raw files (*.raw) or MzML file and shows MS and MS/MS spectra as well as precursor and product ion chromatograms as resizable, floatable tabbed-documents.

Identification and target files can also be loaded to show the spectral and chromatographic evidence. The tool currently supports [MS-GF+](https://msgfplus.github.io/) and [MSPathFinder](https://pnnl-comp-mass-spec.github.io/Informed-Proteomics/) tab-delimited results.

It uses [Informed-Proteomics](https://github.com/PNNL-Comp-Mass-Spec/Informed-Proteomics) for reading spectrum files and can function as a GUI for ProMex and MSPathFinder.

A guide for using LCMS-Spectator can be found on our [GitHub Wiki Page](https://github.com/PNNL-Comp-Mass-Spec/LCMS-Spectator/wiki/Screenshots-with-Descriptions).
